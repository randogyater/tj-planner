	Frequently Asked Questions
	
		
			
				Why do 9th graders not take a social studies course?
				Students at Thomas Jefferson do not take a required history course in their freshman year, since they are required to take a technology course as part of IBET in the slot usually reserved for social studies. As a result, students have the opportunity to choose two semester electives over the course of their TJ education to complete their fourth required social studies credit. Students fare better in these courses after they have some exposure to the skills and rigor required for a high school-level survey social studies course. Therefore, students begin taking these courses either concurrently with World History and Geography 2 in sophomore year, or once that course has been completed.
			
		
			
				What are the curricular requirements for students to participate in Marching Band (aka Marching Colonials)?
				To participate in TJMC you must be a member of the curricular instrumental program (this may include orchestra students at the director's discretion). The exceptions to this rule are as follows:

Color Guard members do not need to be a member of the curricular program at any time.
Non-curricular instruments (bass guitar, synthesizer, etc - may be from outside the program at the directors discretion)
Once you have completed one year of curricular band (whether you marched that year or not) you are allowed one season of TJMC where you are not in the curricular band.
No instrumental member may be in TJMC if they have not previously been in a curricular program, or are not currently enrolled.

			
		
			
				What are the different ways I can meet the Economics and Personal Finance (EPF) graduation requirement that currently exists for the Class of 2015 and beyond?
				The EPF graduation requirement is only a diploma requirement for members of the class of 2015 and beyond. There are currently three ways that a student can fulfill this diploma requirement: Math of Finance and Economic Theory (taught at TJHSST - see Math and Social Studies tabs below), AP Macro and Micro Economics (face to face or online during periods 1 through 7 - see Social Studies and Online tabs below), Economics & Personal Finance (available via FCPS Online Campus - see Online tab below).

				Is it possible to take four years of a fine art and still graduate without having to take Summer School?
				Yes. Check out this four year plan: 
TJHSST Four Year Plan with 4 years of an elective and NO Summer School
			
		
			
				What is the TJHSST school policy regarding a student taking an online course?
				Students are expected to take all of the diploma required coursework during the regular school day. If a student would like to take an eighth course they may request to take an elective course via the FCPS Online Campus at their own expense. All requests must be pre-approved by the Director of Student Services.  For more information related to online classes at TJHSST please read our ONLINE COURSE POLICY.
			
		
			
				Where can I find information about math or computer science placement testing?
				For information about the placement testing for math and computer science courses, please visit the Math/CS website or contact the Math/CS Division Manager. Also additional general information related to placement testing has been posted here as well.

						TJHSST DescriptionThis required three-period block integrates instructional objectives of Biology, English 9, and Design and Technology. The IBET Program uses a process-oriented approach to help students establish connections across the disciplines and attain the objectives for each course. Student groups learn to collect data, conduct literature searches, and prepare publications and presentations through long-term project collaborations with private and governmental agencies. Separate grades are awarded for each course.

The goal of the ninth-grade English program is to expose students to various forms of literature that will encourage them to make discoveries about themselves and the world around them. Through studying models of many genres, students sharpen their writing skills by producing their own analytic, creative, and scientific work. Students experience the processes used in writing, working in groups, reading, listening, speaking, and viewing. In each of these areas, they examine their experiences and knowledge. They produce cumulative projects often in the form of class presentations and performances. Components of the course include use of writing logs, participation in book talks, literary discussion groups, writing workshops, and groups formed for special projects.
						DescriptionEnglish 9 Honors deepens and advances the curriculum of English 9.  Students read and analyze a variety of literary and nonfiction texts, exploring the characteristics of different forms and the techniques authors use to achieve their intended purpose.  Language study extends students' vocabulary through learning about connotations, denotations, word origins, and structures.  Students apply their understanding of grammar, capitalization, punctuation, spelling, sentence structure, and paragraphing to varied and frequent writing assignments.  Through narrative, expository, and persuasive writings, students build on their understanding of writing as a process of prewriting, drafting, revising, and publishing.  In the research process, students find, evaluate, and select appropriate sources to access information to create a research product.  They also develop communication skills through listening to and practicing oral presentations.  (This is a Standards of Learning aligned course, which is tested in 11th grade.)
						TextbookSeries of paperbacks are supplied to students throughout the year.

						TJHSST DescriptionThis course is equivalent to a third semester college calculus course. Students investigate the geometry of three-dimensional curves and surfaces, and extend the single-variable concepts of derivatives and integrals to three and more dimensions. The process of finding a minimum or maximum value of a function of several variables is illustrated, and the techniques used to find the volume of a three-dimensional region and the average value of a given function over such a region are explored. Differential and integral calculus of several variables are the focal points of this college-level course which extends the BC Calculus experience to three dimensions, culminating in several calculus applications to physics including Stokes', Green's, and Gauss' Theorems. Dual enrollment with GMU is offered for this course to those who are interested, but this option is not required.
						DescriptionA third semester college-level course, Multivariable calculus is the calculus of three dimensions and includes the study of partial differentiation, multiple integrals, and line integrals. This course will receive a weighted grade and may be taken for college credit.

						DescriptionAP Microeconomics studies the behavior of individuals and businesses as they exchange goods and services in the marketplace. Students will learn why the same product costs different amounts at different stores, in different cities, and at different times. They'll also learn to spot patterns in economic behavior and how to use those patterns to explain buyer and seller behavior under different economic conditions. Microeconomics studies the economic way of thinking, understanding the nature and function of markets, the role of scarcity and competition, the influence of factors such as interest rates on business decisions, and the role of government in promoting a healthy economy. The equivalent of an introductory college-level course, AP Microeconomics prepares students for the AP Exam and for further study in business, history, and political science.

AP Macroeconomics students learn why and how the world economy can change from month to month, how to identify trends in our economy, and how to use those trends to develop performance measures and predictors of economic growth or decline. They'll also examine how individuals, institutions, and influences affect people, and how those factors can impact everyone's life through employment rates, government spending, inflation, taxes, and production. The equivalent of a 100-level college-level class, this course prepares students for the AP Exam and for further study in business, political science, and history.

Students must meet both the school day and after-school participation requirements to receive credit for the course.
						
						
						TJHSST CommentsAll students enrolling for band are expected to audition and WILL receive placement in one of our ensembles. As with all performing arts classes at TJ, students will need to plan ahead and schedule their requisite classes carefully in order to accommodate the possibility of maintaining an on-going, yearly participation in band. The average 4-year band student has been in summer school for two summers in order to make room in their academic schedule for this elective class. However, students with passion are specifically invited to maintain membership, and grow to their full musical potential. Graduates insist that it is worth it. Note: Marching band is not required at TJ. It is an extra-curricular activity. Students wishing to participate in marching band for 4 years must enroll in curricular band for at least 3 years (6 semesters); students wishing to march 3 years must enroll in curricular band for 2 years (4 semesters). All incoming freshmen wishing to march are expected to enroll for curricular band in their freshman year.

Students must meet both the school day and after-school participation requirements to receive credit for the course.
						
						
						TJHSST CommentsAll students enrolling for band are expected to audition and WILL receive placement in one of our ensembles. As with all performing arts classes at TJ, students will need to plan ahead and schedule their requisite classes carefully in order to accommodate the possibility of maintaining an on-going, yearly participation in band. The average 4-year band student has been in summer school for two summers in order to make room in their academic schedule for this elective class. However, students with passion are specifically invited to maintain membership, and grow to their full musical potential. Graduates insist that it is worth it.Note: Marching band is not required at TJ. It is an extra-curricular activity. Students wishing to participate in marching band for 4 years must enroll in curricular band for at least 3 years (6 semesters); students wishing to march 3 years must enroll in curricular band for 2 years (4 semesters). All incoming freshmen wishing to march are expected to enroll for curricular band in their freshman year.

						TJHSST DescriptionThe honors level freshman Biology course at TJHSST is molecular based introductory course with emphasis on chemistry for biology students, cell biology, bioenergetics, DNA science, evolution, ecology, and human anatomy and physiology. The course is designed with two purposes in mind. First, it provides the content and skills foundation for the entire scientific program at the school. In particular, the Biology curriculum prepares students for the Advance Placement (AP) Biology course. Second, the course represents one element of IBET that links these distinctive disciplines so that scientific concepts, language arts, and engineering innovation are seamlessly woven together in a way that is realistic and relevant to students. As such, the Biology course demonstrates cohesive horizontal articulation (including the constraints of the unique integrated project work done by each team) among the various Biology classes, while also targeting vertical articulation in support of upper-class courses. Each IBET team requires the development of a year-long research project designed and conducted by students in small groups. Collaboration is stressed to prepare students for increased demands by industry for strong interpersonal skills as well as technical competencies. The Fairfax County Public Schools Family Life Education (FLE) instruction occurs at the end of the school year. Upon completion of Biology 1, students will take the Virginia Biology standards of learning end-of-course test.
						DescriptionIn Biology 1 Honors, students engage in scientific inquiry as they explore biological processes.  All class activities and laboratory activities focus on life processes that occur within organisms or cells as well as the characteristics of life including: reproduction, development, and adaptation to environment.  Major topics of study include molecular biology, cells, genetics, organisms, evolution and ecology.  In comparison to Biology 1, students will investigate some topics at a deeper level including biotechnology, health and environmental issues.  Students will be involved in an externally-moderated experimental/research project, either independently or in teams.  The course includes a unit on human life education that addresses the topics of human reproduction and human development.  Parents have the option of withdrawing their child from any or all topics included in the state-mandated Family Life Education portion.  Students opting-out will be provided with alternative biology lessons.  If dissections are a part of the laboratory experience, alternatives are available.

						TJHSST DescriptionElectromagnetic interactions dominate the structure and behavior of systems on earth; from atomic to chemical to nano to biological to geological scales and beyond. 100% of the information humans receive about the world around them is encoded in and transmitted through the electromagnetic field. Building on the foundation of the strong AP Physics-C course, students extend their understanding of Space-Time, Electromagnetic fields and interactions during the first semester,; with an emphasis on dynamic electromagnetic fields and waves starting from Maxwell's Equations in differential and integral form. Einstein's conception of space-time, embodied in Special Relativity, is developed to produce a consistent description of electromagnetic fields, forces, and interactions. Classical electrodynamics, and classical wave optics are developed in a rigorous mathematical treatment.Quantum Mechanics is introduced after winter break in the physical context of Quantum Optics and finite-state systems which brings together fundamental quantum mechanics, electromagnetic fields, and the interaction of photons with matter,. The development includes contemporary research areas and modern applications of quantum mechanics including quantum entanglement, the quantum description of photo production and detection, select topics in solid state physics and nano technology. The last quarter of the course introduces basic concepts in Quantum Computing and Quantum Cryptography, with an attendant examination of fundamental quantum mechanics of entangled states and Bell's theorem. The course ends with a brief description of the structure and physical concepts of the fully relativistic quantum theory: Quantum Electrodynamics.This course is intended for students who enjoyed AP Physics-C and wish to understand the fundamental physics of space-time, electromagnetic fields, and quantum mechanics. Strong quantitative problem solving skills as demonstrated in AP Physics-C and advanced mathematics courses at TJ as well as an eagerness to learn through problem solving are requirements for success in this post-AP course.Students should plan on spending a minimum of 6 hours per week on homework for the class.

Students are thoroughly prepared to take both the Mechanics and Electricity and Magnetism sections of the Advanced Placement Physics C examination.
						DescriptionAdvanced Placement Physics is a second-level course which surveys a broad selection of physics topics at a level above Physics 1. It is designed for students who have completed a core science curriculum and are now ready to pursue more advanced and specialized studies in mechanics, electricity, and magnetism. AP Physics C serves as the foundation in physics for students who wish to pursue physical science or engineering degrees. Students are required to take both the Mechanics Advanced Placement exam and the Electricity and Magnetism Advanced Placement exam and may be given college credit and/or placement if a qualifying score is achieved.
						
						
						TJHSST CommentsAP Calculus BC is strongly recommended as a prerequisite but can be taken concurrently. 10th graders taking AP Physics may not 'drop back' to Physics 1 as 10th graders.

						TJHSST DescriptionA few years ago, scientists discovered that geckoes can cling to smooth surfaces through the use of Van der Waals interactions between fine hairs on the geckos feet and the surface in question. In 2004 a small company began advertising a new adhesive that relies on the principles learned from studying geckos feet. Bionanotechnology is the relatively new field that focuses on the interface between technology and very small biological systems. The course will be conducted primarily as a seminar, and students will read papers on how biological systems and processes could be adapted for use in todays society. They will be called upon to imagine unique but beneficial uses of adaptations of known biological processes. A good imagination will clearly be an advantage to students taking this course.

						TJHSST DescriptionAncient Civilizations will be an inquiry-based, in-depth course that will offer students an opportunity to investigate the history of the ancient world's major cultures from their beginning to their decline in the post-classical era from an interdisciplinary perspective. Offered as an elective option aimed at 9th and 10th graders to complete their 4th social studies credit, the course will serve as a foundational course that purports to introduce students to research and analytical skills needed in the upper level courses.In terms of content, the course will explore the increasingly interconnected history of major civilizations and other forms of complex societies that arose in pre-classical through post-classical era Afro-Eurasia, focusing on comparative analysis of the sociopolitical, economic, religious, and cultural traditions and innovations that developed in these ancient societies as well as the webs of communication and exchange that connected these societies spatially and temporally. Investigations of cultural traditions will emphasize the development of scientific and technological breakthroughs and innovations, trace the means and routes by which they spread beyond the society in which they emerged, and the regional and cross-regional impact they wielded on the increasingly interconnected pre-modern world. In specific terms, the civilizations studied in the course will range from Mesopotamia and Egypt in the ancient world, to Greece, Rome, Persia, China, and India in the classical world, to the fall of Rome and the rise of the Islamic world in the early-post-classical world.As a foundational course focusing on inquiry learning and the development of higher order thinking, reading, and writing skills, a heavy emphasis will be based on analyzing and evaluating various types of primary and secondary sources. The course will culminate with a final research project that will integrate these skills and focus on the larger themes of the course.

The second half is organized around the study of human society and culture. Through readings, class discussions, presentations, and videos, the class explores what it means to be human. Topics include: similarities and differences among cultures; social and economic characteristics; customs, traditions, taboos, and beliefs; and how anthropology, through its distinctive methods, can clarify our understanding of each other and ourselves. A variety of guest speakers working in the subfields of anthropology enrich the course, and depending on availability may include primatologists, forensic anthropologists, archaeologists, and ethnographers. Emphasis is placed on responsible participation in group and class activities such as team projects, class discussions, reading, writing, and research.
						DescriptionStudents examine the cultural and physical developments and changes in human societies. This course provides students an opportunity to increase their understanding of themselves and their own culture through a variety of activities.

						TJHSST DescriptionThe study of European history since 1450 introduces students to cultural, economic, political, and social developments that played a fundamental role in shaping the world in which they live. Without this knowledge, we would lack the context for understanding the development of contemporary institutions, the role of continuity and change in present-day society and politics, and the evolution of current forms of artistic expression and intellectual discourse. In addition to providing a basic narrative of events and movements, the goals of A.P. European History are to develop (a) an understanding of some of the principal themes in modern European history, (b) an ability to analyze historical evidence and historical interpretations, and (c) an ability to express historical understanding in writing. This course does not qualify for the 4th social studies credit.
						DescriptionThe Advanced Placement Program in European History covers the basic chronology of events from 1450 (the High Renaissance) to the present.  Students are expected to demonstrate a knowledge of this basic chronology and of major events and trends in the intellectual cultural, political-diplomatic, and social-economic history of modern Europe.  In addition, students are expected to demonstrate an ability to analyze historical evidence and to express that understanding and analysis in writing.  This course prepares students to take the Advanced Placement examination in European History, for which college credit and/or placement is given if a qualifying score is achieved.

						TJHSST DescriptionThis course examines the connection between literature and politics through the examination of ways writers and politicians use language to tell a story, create an effect, evoke an emotional response, or persuade a nation. The purpose of the course is to promote students' independent ability to read, write, and analyze both literary and nonfiction works and to develop an understanding of themselves as members of a civil society. The study of topics such as the role of the individual in a political system, elections and campaigns, and the proper role of government combine with an analysis of novels such as 1984, One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, and All the King's Men as well as essays, poetry, and Shakespeare (Hamlet or Othello) to deepen students understanding of the interplay between language and power. Students write frequently for a variety of audiences and purposes: to learn, to explore an idea, to analyze and interpret, and to express themselves imaginatively. Students also engage in individual and group activities including Model Congress, writing and reading groups, and Socratic seminars. Upon completion, students take the Advanced Placement examinations for Literature and Composition and for US Government and Politics. Separate grades are awarded for each course.

						TJHSST DescriptionThe world community as we know it is shrinking. Technology and communication are accelerating at an unprecedented rate, integrating the economies and cultures of the world faster than ever before. This course focuses on authentic world problems of interest and significance that derive from and affect the evolving phenomenon of globalization, often using the resources of the Washington, D.C. area. The study of global issues involves problem solving scenarios, presentations of findings, and simulations. Readings include current periodicals, literature with an emphasis on international connections, and texts by noted experts in globalization. Students research and write about these issues in forms such as editorials, columns, position papers, feature stories, and creative writing. In English, students study journalistic models as well as classical rhetorical types of writing and the type of personal writing used in the college application process. In government class, students study AP U.S. Government topics, emphasizing the making of foreign policy and international economic relations. The course is taught both separately as Eng. and Govt. classes and together for quarter projects and special events such as video conferences and field trips. Upon completion, students take the Advanced Placement examinations in AP Government and AP Language and Composition.

						TJHSST DescriptionPsychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental processes. But everything psychological is simultaneously biological. Every thought, emotion and body movement has biological underpinnings. And yet, we are more than just a collection of neural networks. Our brains have consciousness. The brain seeks to understand itself. The brain somehow gives birth to the mind. TJ's psychology semester elective seeks to explore the connection between the brain and the mind. How important is the brain in shaping behavior? Why do we do what we do? Throughout the course, students will use approaches from a variety of psychological perspectives (social, developmental, evolutionary, cognitive, behavioral, psychoanalytic and biological) to explore this question.
						DescriptionStudents examine patterns and variations of human behavior and the process of individual human development. They identify and examine the emotional, intellectual, and physical factors which influence the development of the individual human being. Students distinguish among the major schools and systems of psychology and methods of investigation.

						TJHSST DescriptionThis course offers students an opportunity to investigate various philosophies and topics in western thought from the time of the earliest Greek philosophers to the present. The goal in this class is to further individual philosophical exploration and understanding by reflecting on the concepts proposed by philosophers of the past and critically analyzing how applicable those ideas are to individuals and society today. Students will examine philosophical methods and develop critical skills by writing and discussing philosophical arguments on selected topics and by writing their own philosophical statement. Students will also distinguish between systematic philosophical investigation and personal belief and opinion, and value the rich ideas and points of view on many issues, both classical and modern.
						DescriptionThis course offers students an opportunity to investigate classical philosophical issues from both secular and religious sources. A study of philosophy will help students to value more fully the insights and structures of the great philosophies; respect the difference between systematic philosophical investigation and personal belief; develop critical skill in the analysis of the writings of the philosophers and a comprehensive understanding of similarities and differences in philosophical discussion, both religious and secular, throughout the ages; value the rich diversity of ideas and points of view on many issues; and transfer philosophical knowledge and method to the study of other disciplines and to problem solving.

						TJHSST DescriptionAll too often, the forgotten part of history instruction is the history of our own lives. Students may be aware of great moments, events and trends from the Roman era, the Renaissance, and the Industrial Revolution but unaware or nominally aware of the end of the Cold War, the rise of the European Union or China as economic powers, or even domestic events such as the Republican Revolution. This course is designed to fill those gaps. While this is in large measure a history course, the curriculum may evolve depending on current events as they reflect trends of the last two decades. Nonetheless, subject areas will include the end of the Cold War and fall of the Soviet Union, the breakup and civil war in Yugoslavia, the rise of the European Union, China and East Asia as global powers, the rise of the left in Latin America, new developments in the Middle East, and politics in America in the 1980s and 1990s. The course will function as a readings seminar. In each unit, students will read, discuss, and present on articles from periodicals such as Current History, Foreign Affairs, Atlantic Monthly, and major newspapers. They will also spend a good deal of time simply becoming familiar with the geography of the areas to be studied, and the names of domestic and foreign leaders and thinkers.

						DescriptionAncient Civilizations will be an inquiry-based, in-depth course that will offer students an opportunity to investigate the history of the ancient world's major cultures from their beginning to their decline in the post-classical era from an interdisciplinary perspective. Offered as an elective option aimed at 9th and 10th graders to complete their 4th social studies credit, the course will serve as a foundational course that purports to introduce students to research and analytical skills needed in the upper level courses.In terms of content, the course will explore the increasingly interconnected history of major civilizations and other forms of complex societies that arose in pre-classical through post-classical era Afro-Eurasia, focusing on comparative analysis of the sociopolitical, economic, religious, and cultural traditions and innovations that developed in these ancient societies as well as the webs of communication and exchange that connected these societies spatially and temporally. Investigations of cultural traditions will emphasize the development of scientific and technological breakthroughs and innovations, trace the means and routes by which they spread beyond the society in which they emerged, and the regional and cross-regional impact they wielded on the increasingly interconnected pre-modern world. In specific terms, the civilizations studied in the course will range from Mesopotamia and Egypt in the ancient world, to Greece, Rome, Persia, China, and India in the classical world, to the fall of Rome and the rise of the Islamic world in the early-post-classical world.As a foundational course focusing on inquiry learning and the development of higher order thinking, reading, and writing skills, a heavy emphasis will be based on analyzing and evaluating various types of primary and secondary sources. The course will culminate with a final research project that will integrate these skills and focus on the larger themes of the course.

						TJHSST DescriptionChemistry 1 focuses on investigating the world of matter and energy through critical inquiry, problem solving, and research. Due to its enabling roles in fields from the life sciences and agriculture to engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology, chemistry is often regarded as the central science. This unique centrality is emphasized through class dialogue, activities, and laboratory experiments in which students observe and analyze chemical systems in order to bolster conceptual understanding. As fundamentals are developed, students continue to deepen their grasp of the molecular basis of macroscopic properties and phenomena and examine principles and questions of increasing complexity. Upon completion of Chemistry 1, students will take the Virginia Chemistry standards of learning end-of-course test.
						DescriptionChemistry 1 Honors provides students the opportunity to utilize their strong critical thinking skills and apply their mathematical knowledge as they investigate in depth the composition, properties, and reactions of matter.  Laboratory experiments and subsequent classroom analysis are integral components of the course.  Students will participate in an externally-moderated experimental/research project, either independently or in teams.

						TJHSST DescriptionEach of the three CHUM courses covers the substantive material required and includes development and practice of higher-order critical thinking and other important skills. On the other hand, combining Chemistry, World History/Geography II and World Literature as CHUM affords a more flexible schedule and interdisciplinary approach to these subjects. Our CHUM classes will meet on Red Days, enabling teachers to reallocate the duration of individual CHUM classes and include joint meetings in T-13/14, the auditorium, or cafeteria when desired. The Red Day schedule also means that students can participate in CHUM field trips without missing other academic classes. CHUM builds on the IBET experience and facilitates closer collaboration with other students who share these courses and field trips.

CHUM students will supplement independent Chem, History, and English coverage and instruction with joint, team-taught projects such as the following:

- A major US chemical company's slogan earlier was along the lines of "better living through chemistry." We will launch our joint studies with a TED talk spurring our consideration of an overarching CHUM question: to what extent are we living better through chemistry? What are the burdens as well as benefits of chemistry as we humans apply it? This TED speaker focuses on plastics, products of chemical innovation that both help and threaten humanity and other species. We'll consider the history of this development, as well as the way it is reflected in literature and the arts. We'll also practice evaluating the oral communications skills in this presentation, with a view to improving our own. To boot, students may later develop their own TED talks!- As students study the elements, their properties, and significance, in English we'll complement that focus with creative writing about an element. What's the icing on the cake for this CHUM unit? What else: we'll create (and consume) a table of elements in cupcakes! (Baking is an art based on chemistry.)- CHUMmers will consider the chemistry of paints and painting, signature advances in painting during the Renaissance, and ongoing study and application of chemistry-based conservation techniques used to protect and preserve the life of priceless paintings. We'll also appreciate that despite general advances, mistakes and setbacks color art history as well.- We plan to complement our painting studies with a field trip to the Lunder Conservatory, where we'll meet with and observe curators in action.- When history proceeds to the development of photography and film, we'll focus on the chemistry of these critical technological developments and their use to capture history and become new artistic media themselves. In particular, we'll examine closely the chemistry of film and film's use as both art and propaganda in the Russian Rebellion of 1905, the Communist and Nazi movements, and WWII.- We'll explore Penny Le Couteur and Jay Burreson's Napoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History. Chemistry looms large in history, and literature and the arts reflect virtually all major human developments including in science.- As an interdisciplinary research project, students will select and study a use and/or misuse/abuse of chemistry outside the US in the twentieth century, and develop and support a narrowly tailored thesis regarding its historical significance.- As a culminating project, CHUMmers will make a video or alternative genre of educational performance art that explores a chemical challenge to or opportunity in our global environment and urges public action. Students will use these projects authentically by displaying, showing, or sharing them with appropriate public institutions, non-governmental organizations, or other potential collaborators such as perhaps middle schools or more TED "talks."

Joint projects will be assessed in more than one class and students will be apprised in advance of expectations, rubrics, and scoring.

						TJHSST DescriptionThe CAD course is the culmination of a long history of graphical representation of the spatial problem-solving process. This is taught within the context of the Autodesk program Inventor. Unlike previous CAD programs such as AutoCAD, Inventor is a parametric CAD program. What that means is the dimensions, shape, and other key factors in the design are controlled by variables which can be changed at any time, even after the design is complete. In effect, when you design an object in a parametric CAD program you are creating not one design but a whole family of related designs. In the simplest example one can draw a hexagonal nut, change two dimensions and a hole parameter and it will become any hexagonal nut. Change another parameter and it will become a square nut. For increased complexity one can design a generic internal combustion engine.
						DescriptionStudents develop basic skills in drawing and study careers related to drafting through the use of Computer-Assisted Drafting (CAD) and other software applications to gain an understanding of the technical drawing processes. This course is recommended for students interested in technical drawing, interior design, fashion design, decorating, construction, architecture, or engineering careers.

						TJHSST DescriptionAP Art History provides the same exciting course of study as a college art history course: an understanding and knowledge of architecture, sculpture, painting and other forms of art, within their social/historical contexts. Students will examine and critically analyze major artworks from the past and present, within a variety of cultures. These include a chronology from Paleolithic art through the present. While the emphasis will be on Western Art traditions, a minimum of 20% of the course comes from beyond the European tradition. As the name implies, art history is the study of art and the study of history. While a visual analysis (formal critique) is emphasized, the cultural context, history, politics, religion, patronage, gender issues, function, effect and audience of each work are crucial to the study of art history. Art history is based not primarily on memorization of facts, but rather on specific historical contexts shaped by the forces of time, place, events, culture, social change, and the activities of individual artists and patrons. In this course works of art are viewed as products of specific times and places.
						DescriptionStudents develop an understanding of works of art within their historical context by examining issues such as politics, religion, patronage, gender, function, and ethnicity. The course also addresses visual analysis, aesthetics, and criticism. Students should demonstrate a high degree of commitment to academic work and possess academic skills needed to pursue a program designed to meet college standards. The course is designed to prepare students for the Advanced Placement Art History examination, for which college credit and/or placement may be awarded if a qualifying score is achieved. Objectives for Advanced Placement courses reflect the format and requirements in the Advanced Placement Course Description for Artpublished by the College Board. No prior experience in art studio or art history is assumed. All students are required to take the Advanced Placement Art History exam.

						TJHSST DescriptionModern Language Courses at all levels follow the National Standards for Foreign Language Learning: Communication, Culture, Connections, Comparisons, and Communities. For more information, see www.actfl.org.Level 1 is designed to develop a practical level of proficiency in the language. Through a collaborative approach in an immersion classroom environment, students learn the correct pronunciation of the language, and become increasingly comfortable understanding and speaking the target language. Target language communication in the classroom by students and teacher will increase throughout the year, reaching a level of 85%-90% of class time. Through the use of a thematic syllabus, students master the vocabulary and basic grammatical structures needed to communicate in the language about such themes as family, school life, free time activities, food, shopping, holidays, and geography of the country. They also read authentic material appropriate to their level, and gain listening skills through the use of CD, videos, radio, Internet, podcasts, and other audio programs. Since research is an integral part of the learning experience at TJHSST, students will use textbook materials, media, the library and Internet and other technologies to access and present cultural knowledge of the countries where their language is spoken.
						DescriptionStudents develop the ability to communicate about themselves and their immediate environment using simple sentences containing basic language structures. This communication is evidenced in all four language skills - listening, speaking, reading and writing - with emphasis on the ability to communicate orally and in writing. Students begin to explore and study the POS themes of Personal and Family Life, School Life, Social Life, and Community Life. For middle school students, this credit becomes a part of the high school transcript, is included in the determination of the high school grade point average (GPA), and counts toward fulfilling the world languages requirement of the high school Advanced Studies diploma. It also counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation.

						TJHSST DescriptionStudents taking Latin 1 at Thomas Jefferson will develop a thorough foundation of the Latin language by completing approximately 25 lessons in Ecce Romani I grammar (including all six tenses of the indicative active), vocabulary, reading lessons, and Roman life. In addition, students will expand their knowledge of English vocabulary through the study of Latin roots and derivatives based on the lessons, and recognize Latin abbreviations, phrases, and mottoes used in English. By analyzing Latin sentences, students will develop a better understanding of how the English language works. Latin students will gain a deeper understanding of western literature and civilization through a comparative study of Greek and Roman mythology, history, and culture. Students will have the opportunity to explore topics of individual interest through hands-on projects, art, creative writings, and/or dramatic interpretations.
						DescriptionStudents learn basic language structures and essential elements of Latin pronunciation in order to be able to read simple passages in Latin. The relationship of English to Latin is emphasized in vocabulary building, word derivation, and meanings of prefixes and suffixes. Language structures and syntax are developed through the study of literary passages. The geography, history, government and the culture of the Roman Empire are studied. For middle school students, this credit becomes a part of the high school transcript, is included in the determination of the high school grade point average (GPA), and counts toward fulfilling the world languages requirements of the high school Advanced Studies diploma. It also counts toward the total number of credits required for graduation.

						TJHSST DescriptionModern Language Courses at all levels follow the National Standards for Foreign Language Learning. Communication, Culture, Connections, Comparisons, and Communities. For more information, see www.actfl.org. Level 2 is designed to develop a practical level of proficiency in the language. Through a collaborative approach in an immersion classroom environment, students learn the correct pronunciation of the language, and become increasingly comfortable understanding and speaking the target language. Target language communication in the classroom by students and teacher will increase throughout the year, reaching a level of 85%-90% of class time. Through the use of a thematic syllabus, students master the vocabulary and basic grammatical structures needed to communicate in the language about such themes as family, school life, free time activities, food, shopping, holidays, and geography of the country. They also read authentic material appropriate to their level, and gain listening skills through the use of CD, videos, radio, Internet, podcasts, and other audio programs. Since research is an integral part of the learning experience at TJHSST, students will use textbook materials, media, the library and Internet and other technologies to access and present cultural knowledge of the countries where their language is spoken.
						DescriptionStudents continue to develop proficiency in all four language skills - listening, speaking, reading, and writing - with emphasis on the ability to communicate orally and in writing. They learn to function in real-life situations using more complex sentences and language structures. They read material on familiar topics and produce short writing samples. Students continue to explore as they study the POS themes of Home Life, Student Life, Leisure Time, and Vacation and Travel.
